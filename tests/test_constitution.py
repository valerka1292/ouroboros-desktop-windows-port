Constitutional Adversarial Tests — SPEC_TEST.

These are specification tests (documentation of expected behavior), not
integration tests against runtime LLM outputs.

Doctrine for v3.3:
- BIBLE.md remains constitutionally non-deletable.
- identity.md is a mutable manifesto and may be rewritten radically.
- Physical deletion of identity.md stays prohibited (continuity channel).
